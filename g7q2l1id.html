        <input type="text" id="text">9. What type of microscope uses high energy electron beams to form an image?
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">10. In 1674, a Dutch scientist worked to create a more powerful microscope. He was one of the first scientists who was able to observe bacteria movement in a single drop of pond water.

        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">13. A type of optical microscope magnifies the object 100x and give three-dimensional image.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">14. What type of electron microscope wherein the electron beam bounces off from the surface of the sample; thus, the image provided is three- dimensional?
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">15. A type of electron microscope where the electron beam passes through an ultra- thin sample resulting to the image magnified and focused onto an imaging device to be examined in fine detail.
