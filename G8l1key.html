        <h1>EARTHQUAKES AND FAULTS<h1>
        <p>- energy makes the ground move, friction hold rocks together, ground will move and earthquake will occur once friction is overcome
        <p>    Earthquake - sudden slip on a fault, released in the form of energy 
        <p>    Creep - faults/blocks move slowly to each other
        <p>    Fault - fracture or zone of fractures, may range in length, produce repeated displacements
        <p> Normal - block above moved downward, hanging wall down to the footwall
        <p> Reverse - thrust fault, upper block moves up and over, hanging wall thrust over the footwall, common in areas of compression
        <p> Strike-Slip - blocks slide past each other, San Andreas
        <p>    -    Left lateral - left block moves toward
        <p>    -    Right lateral - right block moves toward
        <p>    Stress - plates are pushed or pulled together
        <p> Compression - rocks push or squeeze against one another then arise, targets the center, horizontal–crust thickens or shortens, vertical–crust thins out or break off, mountains
        <p> Tension - rocks pull apart, plates can move farther away or a plate can move in different direction, reason why Pangaea were broken off
        <p> Shear - templates rub each other, pushes some of the crust in different directions, can cause earthquakes
        <p> Confining - crust compacts which makes it smaller, stress is applied to all sides of crust, cause sinkholes
