        <input type="text" id="text">6. There are five major parts of the microscope.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">7. Illuminating parts supply and regulate sound towards the specimen.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">8. Magnifying parts make the specimen bigger or appear larger.
