        <h1>THE MICROSCOPE<h1>
        <p>Cell - basic unit
        </p>multicellular: trillions of cells
    </p>unicellular: one cell
</p>Development of Microscope 
</p>Hans and Zacharias Janssen (1590s) - Dutch eyeglass makers, first compound microscope–lens at the end of a small tube
</p>Galileo Galilei (1625) - invent one of the first compound microscope–has more than one lens, added a focusing device
</p>Robert Hooke (1665) - discovered cells (small, empty rooms like in monastery) when he examined everything (thin slice of cork) with the help of microscopes
</p>Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1674) - Dutch scientist, created stronger lenses, first to observe bacteria movement
</p>Joseph Jackson Lister (1830) - prototype for the compound microscope–reduces the chromatic effect using several weak lenses together
</p>Ernst Abbe (1872) - research director of Zeiss Optical Works, Abbe Sine Condition–calculation for the maximum resolution in the microscope back then
</p>Richard Zsigmondy (1903) - ultra-microscope– study objects below the wavelength of light, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1925)
</p>Frits Zernike (1932) - phase-contrast microscope–study of colorless and transparent biological materials, won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1953)
</p>Charles Spencer (19th century) - founder of an American company produced fine optical microscope along with Zeiss in Germany
</p>Microscope - Ancient Greek micros–small, skopein–to look, can help see tiny objects and living organisms
</p>Magnification - how much larger an object appears, on the side of the lens (magnification power of the ocular lens * power of the objective lens)
</p>Resolution or resolving power - capacity of a microscope to distinguish finer details
</p>Types: 
</p>Optical - uses visible light, uses glass lenses, eyepiece
</p>Compound - uses two or more double convex lenses, 1200x 
</p>Stereomicroscope - dissecting microscope, 100x, gives 3D image
</p>Electron - uses high energy electron beams, photographic plate or computer screen, 2Mx 
</p>Transmission (TEM) - passes through, focused onto an imaging device (fluorescent screen)
</p>Scanning (SEM) - bounces off, 3D
</p>Microscopy - the science of investigating small objects and structures
</p>Parts: 
</p>Eyepiece or Ocular Lens - used to look through 
</p>Body tube or Lens tube - connected task is to hold the eyepiece
</p>Revolving nosepiece - holds objective lenses, movable, can revolve depending on the magnification power
</p>Arm - connects base to the head, eyepiece to the base, supports head, used when carrying
</p>Objectives/Objective lenses - major lenses, schools have light microscope (three or four objectives)
</p>   -     scanner - shortest one, 3x, 4x, 5x
</p>   -     lower power (LPO) - 10x, 12x
</p>   -     high power (HPO) - 40x, 43x, 60x
</p>Stage - platform
</p>Stage clips - hold the slides 
</p>Diaphragm - controls the light that passes through
</p>Coarse adjustment - focuses images (scanner and LPO)
</p>Fine adjustment - focus images (HPO and oil-immersion objectives)
</p>Light source - provides light, lamp or mirror
</p>Base - supports the microscope</p>
