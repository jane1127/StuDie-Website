            <h1>The Microscope.</h1> 
            <p>Cell - basic unit <br>
                - multicellular: trillions of cells <br>
                - unicellular: one cell <br>
                <br>
                  Development of Microscope <br>
                 - Hans and Zacharias Janssen (1590s) - Dutch eyeglass makers, first compound microscope–lens at the end of a small tube <br>
                 - Galileo Galilei (1625) - invent one of the first compound microscope–has more than one lens, added a focusing device <br>
                 - Robert Hooke (1665) - discovered cells (small, empty rooms like in monastery) when he examined everything (thin slice of cork) with the help of microscopes <br>
                 - Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1674) - Dutch scientist, created stronger lenses, first to observe bacteria movement <br>
                 - Joseph Jackson Lister (1830) - prototype for the compound microscope–reduces the chromatic effect using several weak lenses together <br>
                 - Ernst Abbe (1872) - research director of Zeiss Optical Works, Abbe Sine Condition–calculation for the maximum resolution in the microscope back then <br>
                 - Richard Zsigmondy (1903) - ultra-microscope– study objects below the wavelength of light, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry (1925) <br>
                 - Frits Zernike (1932) - phase-contrast microscope–study of colorless and transparent biological materials, won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1953) <br>
                 - Charles Spencer (19th century) - founder of an American company produced fine optical microscope along with Zeiss in Germany <br>
                 <br>
                      Microscope - Ancient Greek micros–small, skopein–to look, can help see tiny objects and living organisms <br>
                     - Magnification - how much larger an object appears, on the side of the lens (magnification power of the ocular lens * power of the objective lens) <br>
                     - Resolution or resolving power - capacity of a microscope to distinguish finer details <br>
                     <br>
                       Types: <br>
                       - Optical - uses visible light, uses glass lenses, eyepiece <br>
                       - Compound - uses two or more double convex lenses, 1200x <br>
                       - Stereomicroscope - dissecting microscope, 100x, gives 3D image <br>
                       - Electron - uses high energy electron beams, photographic plate or computer screen, 2Mx  <br>
                       - Transmission (TEM) - passes through, focused onto an imaging device (fluorescent screen) <br>
                       - Scanning (SEM) - bounces off, 3D <br>
                      Microscopy - the science of investigating small objects and structures <br>
                      <br>
                       Parts: <br>
                       - Eyepiece or Ocular Lens - used to look through  <br>
                       - Body tube or Lens tube - connected task is to hold the eyepiece <br>
                       - Revolving nosepiece - holds objective lenses, movable, can revolve depending on the magnification power <br>
                       - Arm - connects base to the head, eyepiece to the base, supports head, used when carrying <br>
                       - Objectives/Objective lenses - major lenses, schools have light microscope (three or four objectives) <br>
                          -     scanner - shortest one, 3x, 4x, 5x <br>
                          -     lower power (LPO) - 10x, 12x <br>
                          -     high power (HPO) - 40x, 43x, 60x <br>
                       - Stage - platform <br>
                       - Stage clips - hold the slides  <br>
                       - Diaphragm - controls the light that passes through <br>
                       - Coarse adjustment - focuses images (scanner and LPO) <br>
                       - Fine adjustment - focus images (HPO and oil-immersion objectives) <br>
                       - Light source - provides light, lamp or mirror <br>
                       - Base - supports the microscope <br>
