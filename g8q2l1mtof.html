        <input type="text" id="text">1. Fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between blocks of rocks.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">2. Landslides are caused by a sudden slip on a fault.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">3. Normal Fault is a dip-slip fault in which the block above the fault has moved downward relative to the block below.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">4. There are 3 types of strike-slip fault.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">5. Confining Stress applied to all sides of the crust.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">6. The Earth has three layers, the crust, mantle, and the core.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">7. Earthquakes are classified according to the movement of two blocks.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">8. Shear Stress is the force of the stress that pushes some of the crust in the same direction.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">9. Tension Stress is the opposite of Shear Stress.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">10. The crust is broken into several parts, known as the continental plates.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">11.The stress occurs when the plates are pulled or pushed together.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">12. When the dip angle is shallow, the normal fault is often described as a thrust fault.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">13. There are four types of stresses that can affect Earth's crust.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">14. The tectonic plates are always moving slowly, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">15. Strike-slip fault occurs when the "hanging wall" moves down relative to the "foot wall".
