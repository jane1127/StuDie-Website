        <input type="text" id="text">5. Hans Christian Oersted showed how a current carrying wire behaves like a magnet.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">6. The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum organized by frequency and wavelength, progressing from the highest to the lowest frequencies.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">7. Maxwell concluded, based on theoretical assumptions and Faraday's experiments, that the speed of electromagnetic waves is 6 x 10‚Å∏ m/s.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">8. Radio and TV waves have the longest wavelengths and the lowest frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum.

        <input type="text" id="text">9. Accelerating photons produce electromagnetic waves.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">10. Infrared are radio waves of very short wavelength.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">11. Visible waves are waves that lie in the region beyond the red end of the visible spectrum.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">12. Microwaves are the shortest waves present that can be detected by the eye.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">13. Ultraviolet waves are invisible radiation that lie beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum.
        <br>
        <input type="text" id="text">14.  X-rays have short wavelengths and high frequencies and are low-penetrating.
        <br>
